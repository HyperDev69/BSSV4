My first open source🎉

😸Brawl Stars V4 server without database based on ObiadBrawl.
⚠️The server isn't for Prod, tho you can add your own packets to it, it won't be updated.⚠️
# Features 🛠️
-Offline battles

-Club

-Gamerooms
# Set up 🧱
Use Python 3.9 and change port in settings.json to your port.👨‍💻
You can use it to make your own simple v4! (but don't forget to credit me)😉
# Client 🔨
You can use ObiadBrawl's client or set up your own one, I used HxD to set up my client.
# Base server 😻
